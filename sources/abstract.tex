%The key novelty of our work is that it uses SMAP facilities already supported by mainstream Intel CPU to achieve negligible runtime overhead when monitoring kernel to user space accessing activities. Also we use a hypervisor layer to establish a process based fine-grain control of system wide hardware feature, in this case, SMAP, in order to reduce unnecessary performance overhead that waste on protection needless scenarios.

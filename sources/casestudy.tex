\subsection{Case studies}
To understand better TOCTOU vulnerabilities, we analyzed in detail several real vulnerabilities of the Windows operating system. Although listing these vulnerabilities is not difficult, since, for most of them, there is no exploit nor details released previously, understanding, analyzing, and reproducing them took us much error. In the following case study, we first briefly introduce where and how the TOCTOU happens for each case. Then we reproduce the scenario; in other words, write POC (proof of concept) code to trigger the vulnerability. At last, we demonstrate and explain how our mitigation works such vulnerability again in detail.
